            <p>I'm doing soo much music these days, it's great - I have an Irish trio which is going well, paid gigs, etc, a rock band where we experiment and improvise, and now I've just started playing with a brilliant female jazz guitarist, doing the old jazz standards, grappelli-style. I still have my day job, but my main focus has been entirely packing in as much playing as possible. It's the thing I enjoy the most. How is your new album coming along?</p>

            <p>The tour I'm organising is coming together, the Dutch band will be here from the 2nd to the 13th, shame you won't be around then. You could join us for some of the tour later, though. I'm meant to be hiring a van and driving them to all the gigs, what a mapcap idea in the middle of winter, but in for a penny, in for a pound ;)</p>

            <p>You sound like you're having fun, we'd love to see you - and your new girl :) any time you're in Paris, you can bring me news of the outside world, going to the shops is a military operation these days, but I really appreciate it when I do get there!</p>

            <p>How is life treating you? Hope you did well yesterday and enjoyed it as much as possible! Regarding your invitation to madrid: that sounds awesome and we would love to come. we just don't know yet, if we'll both get off 2 weeks at the same time in summer, but we'll definitely keep you posted.</p>

            <p>Cheers for the fantastic email, we've been laughing out loud. It sure was better than 'On the Road' and 'Easy Rider' combined. I can't believe all the scrapes and adventures you've had, and you're still in one piece! What's up next?</p>

            <p>How is it going? Let me know your plans around early October! Would be great to catch up, I think we will have fun and do a lot of nothing anyway ;)</p>

            <p>As you know last year was a bit of a mess and I'm still trying to recover from the aftermath both financially and mentally. However, I am beyond any doubt planning to return to the heartland of Europe in May, so let's try and meet up soon!</p>

            <p>The new house is great! Really enjoying having more space. Wishing I could snap my fingers and have it fully furnished, though... it's taking so long. Worst thing is figuring out the zillion window dressings - big disadvantage of this building.</p>
